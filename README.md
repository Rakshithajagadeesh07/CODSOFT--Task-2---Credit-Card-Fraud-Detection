# CODSOFT--Task-2---Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project that implements credit card fraud detection using logistic regression. The goal of the project is to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the given features, such as transaction amount, time, and other transaction-related details.

### Steps for Implementing Credit Card Fraud Detection
1.Data Collection:

The first step is gathering a dataset that contains features of credit card transactions such as transaction amount, time, location, and user behavior patterns. The dataset should be labeled, identifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

2.Data Preprocessing:

Feature Selection: Choose the most relevant features for the model. Typically, transactions data may have many features, but only a few might be significant for detecting fraud.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, remove outliers, and normalize features where necessary. Since credit card fraud is rare, the dataset is usually imbalanced, with significantly fewer fraud cases than legitimate ones. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) can help balance the classes.
Train/Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

3.Model Building:

Logistic regression will model the probability that a transaction is fraudulent based on the input features.

4.Model Evaluation:

After training, evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to measure performance.

5.Model Optimization:

Hyperparameter tuning, regularization (L1 or L2), and threshold adjustment can further refine the model to avoid overfitting or underfitting and improve its ability to detect fraud.

6.Deployment:

Once the model performs well, it can be deployed into a production environment where it will predict whether each new transaction is likely to be fraudulent. Real-time detection systems may also incorporate this model to flag suspicious transactions as they occur.

7.Post-Deployment Monitoring:

Continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure the model remains accurate over time, especially since fraud patterns can evolve. Retraining the model periodically with updated data helps maintain its effectiveness.

### Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of logistic regression for detecting credit card fraud. By leveraging a well-processed dataset and handling class imbalance, the model effectively distinguishes between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
